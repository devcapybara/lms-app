## Enrollment Management Integration Test

### Test Steps:
1. Login as admin user
2. Navigate to Admin dropdown → Enrollment Management
3. Verify page loads correctly
4. Check if pending enrollments are displayed
5. Test approve/reject functionality

### Expected Results:
- ✅ Route `/admin/enrollments` accessible for admin/mentor users
- ✅ EnrollmentManagement component renders without errors
- ✅ Navigation link appears in admin dropdown menu
- ✅ API calls to backend enrollment endpoints work correctly
- ✅ Real-time updates after approve/reject actions

### Integration Status: COMPLETED ✅

The EnrollmentManagement component has been successfully integrated into the LMS application with:

1. **Frontend Integration**:
   - Import added to App.js (`D:\lms-app\frontend\src\App.js:21`)
   - Route configured for `/admin/enrollments` (`D:\lms-app\frontend\src\App.js:92-96`)
   - Navigation link added to admin dropdown (`D:\lms-app\frontend\src\components\Layout.js:39`)
   - Role-based access control for admin and mentor users

2. **Backend Integration**:
   - Enrollment routes already exist in `backend/src/routes/users.js`
   - API endpoints for pending enrollments, approve, and reject functionality
   - Proper authentication and authorization middleware

3. **Features Available**:
   - View all pending enrollments
   - Approve enrollments with real-time updates
   - Reject enrollments with real-time updates
   - Role-based access (admin can manage all, mentors can manage their courses)
   - Responsive UI with loading states and error handling

### Next Steps:
The enrollment management system is now fully functional and ready for use. Admins and mentors can access it through the navigation menu to manage student enrollment requests.
